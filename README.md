# School_Project

In this Folder, i have:

+) Experiment 1: This is Big-Project about constructing a processor to connect simple input (switches) and output devices (LEDs and 7-segment) to an Intel FPGA chip "DE10-Standard" and implement a circuit that uses these devices.
(*) Using VerilogSystem HDLanguage


+) Experiment 2: This is Big-Project about designing an IP that performs trigonometric functions: sine, cosine using Avalon Memory Map protocol.
(*) Using VerilogSystem HDLanguage

+) Experiment 3: This is a Mini-Project, building a system using Nios II in Intel FPGA chip DE10 to connect a peripheral LCD 16x2 and an H-bridge to control a motor and display information.
(*) Using VHDL
